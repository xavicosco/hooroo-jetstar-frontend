# Instructions



We would like you to work on this coding test so we can see how you would approach building out this feature.



## User Story to Implement 


As a user of Qantas hotels i would like to see a list of hotels that can be sorted by price - the list should show an image (145 px wide, 125 px high).



## More Information


Use the attached image of the search page as a guide and feel free to use any framework/technology that you feel comfortable with.


We think you should spend a max of 3-4 hours on the code test, we consider it a starting point to extend and modify in our technical interview. 
If your not able to complete this in the next week let us know.


We value writing well tested code at Hooroo and would like to see tests around any code you write.



## Included files

- 
Json payload (pretend this was returned by a RESTful API)


- Image of stripped down Qantas search results
- 
Image of the dropdown sorting options


Implement at least one of the sorting options.

- Top Deals - Hotels with best savings

- Price (high-low) - Hotels highest price to lowest price

- Price (low-high) - Hotels lowest price to highest price

- Name (A-Z) - Hotels in alphabetical order



Star ratings on properties are defined into two types ‘star’ and ‘self’ rated. 
Properties that are ‘self’ rated use a circle icon and properties that are ‘star’ rated use a star icon.


Feel free to send through any questions you may have.
